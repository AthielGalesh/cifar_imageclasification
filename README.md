# cifar_imageclasification ---(WIP)---
CNN algorythm utilizing a CIFAR1000 pre-trained neuronal-network to classify images loaded by the user. The main idea is to allow the user to upload an image about organic material like a vegetable or an animal,
and based on a Cox proportional hazards model, estimate it's age in days/years.

The code is intended to work on a Render web service environment.
